#Design Choices

My goal was a device that had a pleasing aesthetic, minimized distractions, and was simple to use.

With those criteria in mind, three of my first design decisions were:
1. An e-ink screen.  This would force the "slow tech" feeling, because it could not be updated quickly. It also adds to the aesthetic, by not emitting any light and the "is it a screen or a static image?" quality.
2. Wireless charging.  Having cables or plugs would reduce the convience, and destroy the feeling that this was different from other devices that you use in your day-to-day.  At the time I built this (2017), wireless charging was not very common, so this felt like it added a little magic as well.
3. A wooden case. I wanted it to feel like something that was deceptively low-tech from its exterior.

Over time the aesthetic evolved from a wooden box, to an attempt to evoke an old time radio. I decided etched wood, with accent colors in a different tone would fit the bill. Unfortunately, I had no experience with building anything from wood, nor building cases for electronic devices, so the case, while pretty from the outside, is definitely one of the most hacky parts on the inside.

While the e-ink screen was great for the aesthetic and display of slow-changing information, there needed to be some immediate feedback for the user interface.  You can't select which podcast to listen to, if there's no see the names! So I added an LED array which, when inactive, is not visible and appears to be part of a speaker grille (there is no internal speaker in actuality).
